 @defgroup msg_examples MSG examples
 @ingroup MSG_API
 @brief Find the MSG example fitting your needs from the extensive set provided in the archive.

  - @ref msg_ex_tracing
    - @ref msg_ex_tracing_user_variables

@warning MSG was deprecated in SimGrid v3.18. These examples should be
         converted to S4U in the next releases. You really should
         consider using S4U in your next project.

@section msg_ex_tracing Tracing and visualization features

Tracing can be activated by various configuration options which
are illustrated in these example. See also the 
@ref tracing_tracing_options "full list of options related to tracing".

It is interesting to run the process-create example with the following
options to see the task executions:

  - <b>Setting Categories</b>.
    @ref examples/deprecated/msg/trace-categories/trace-categories.c \n
    This example declares several tracing categories
    to that are used to classify its tasks. When the program is executed,
    the tracing mechanism registers the resource utilization of hosts
    and links according to these categories. Recommanded options:
    @verbatim --cfg=tracing:yes --cfg=tracing/categorized:yes --cfg=tracing/uncategorized:yes
    @endverbatim
    
  - <b>Master Workers tracing</b>.
    @ref examples/deprecated/msg/trace-masterworker/trace-masterworker.c \n
    This is an augmented version of our basic master/worker example
    using several tracing features. It traces resource usage, sorted
    out in several categories; Trace marks and user variables are also
    used. Recommanded options:
    @verbatim --cfg=tracing/categorized:yes --cfg=tracing/uncategorized:yes
    @endverbatim
    
  - <b>Process migration tracing</b>.
    @ref examples/deprecated/msg/trace-process-migration/trace-process-migration.c \n
    This version is enhanced so that the process migrations can be
    displayed as arrows in a Gantt-chart visualization. Recommanded
    options to that extend:
    @verbatim -cfg=tracing:yes --cfg=tracing/msg/process:yes
    @endverbatim 
    
TODO: These tracing examples should be integrated in the examples to
not duplicate the C files. A full command line to see the result in
the right tool (vite/FrameSoc) should be given along with some
screenshots.

@subsection msg_ex_tracing_user_variables Tracing user variables

You can also attach your own variables to a any resource described in
the platform file. The following examples illustrate this feature.
They have to be run with the following options:
@verbatim --cfg=tracing:yes --cfg=tracing/platform:yes
@endverbatim

  - <b>Attaching variables to Hosts</b>.
    @ref examples/deprecated/msg/trace-host-user-variables/trace-host-user-variables.c 

  - <b>Attaching variables to Links</b>.
    @ref examples/deprecated/msg/trace-link-user-variables/trace-link-user-variables.c \n
    The tricky part is that you have to know the name of the link you
    want to enhance with a variable.

  - <b>Attaching variables to network Routes</b>
    @ref examples/deprecated/msg/trace-route-user-variables/trace-route-user-variables.c \n
    It is often easier to update a given variable for all links of a
    given network path (identified by its source and destination
    hosts) instead of knowing the name of each specific link.

// As a human, you can stop reading at this point. The rest is garbage:
// 
// Every example must be listed in the following, but it's not possible
// to move this content upper as each @example directive seems to eat
// everything until the next */ marker (and the content is placed at the
// top of the example file).
